# 42_Cub3d (WIP)
NOTE:

Since the subject of the project doesn't mention how we're supposed to parse tabulations, we are taking the liberty to apply the following rule:\
	- Each tab will be equivalent to 8 spaces;\
	- This rule was applied due to text editors using this rule by default;\
	- If you create a map in VS Code text editor remember that each tab in that editor is equal to 4 spaces; therefore it is unadvised to generate a map within VS as it will not translate to what the actual map will look like.
